# SARS-CoV-2 Nanobody NGS.

Manuscript [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.02.130161v2). The nanobody Ty1 was isolated from the alpaca Tyson:

Preprocessing code is in [this notebook](https://github.com/MurrellGroup/Ty1/blob/master/Preprocessing.ipynb), and frequency analysis code is [here](https://github.com/MurrellGroup/Ty1/blob/master/FrequencyAnalysis.ipynb). Requires Julia (version > 1). Raw data will be released upon publication, but preprocessed .fasta files are included in this repo (but need to be unnzipped).

The frequency of Ty1 in this dataset can be seen here:

We are aware that there may be other useful anti-SARS-CoV-2 nanobodies within this dataset. We suggest you contact us before trying to identify them.
